## Setting up CircleCI

Set up CircleCI to run the build job for each branch and build-and-release for each tag.

1. Go to [CircleCI Dashboard](https://circleci.com/dashboard).
2. In the top left, you will find the Org switcher. Select your Organisation.
3. If this is your first project on CircleCI, go to the Projects page, click the **Add Projects** button, then click the **Set Up Project** button next to your project. You may also click **Start Building** to manually trigger your first build.
4. To manage GitHub releases using CircleCI, you need to add your github personal access token to your project's environment variables.
   - Follow the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) to create a personal access token. For CircleCI releases, you would need the `repo` scope.
   - Add the environment variable to your project as `GITHUB_TOKEN` by following the instructions [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).
